            <strong>Documentation:</strong> In the process of your work list the problems you encounter and the solutions you find. After you're done, pick out one of the problems - the most interesting one - and write 2 paragraphs about it and how it was solved. Capture a video of your animation. Post your sketch on openProcessing.</p>

        <h3>Project 2: Representing natural systems in code</h3>

        <p>Create a sketch that would simulate an existing natural system - look at physics, biology, and other natural sciences for good examples. Start with the environment - where is the system situated? What are the forces the environment might exert on the system? Examine the agents in the system, their relationships to each other and the environment they are in. The look at how this system would develop over time. What are the rules that you are going to come up with, what are the parameters you are going to feed into them and what effect will the changes have on the development of the system.</p>
        <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> create two diagrams: explaining the components of the system and their relationships, and the rules (algorhythms) and how they unford over time. Write about the approximation - which aspects of the natural system that you simulated did you decide NOT to represent and why? Post your work on openProcessing.</p>

        <h3>Project 3: Anything is an interface</h4>
        <p>Create an interactive system (a game, a story, a performance, etc) that relies on the recognition and tracking of the real-world objects by a machine learning system (ML5js). Explore the possibilities of the technology: what it can and cannot do? how subtle can the variations be? what is easy and what is hard to do with the existing tech? Starting with your big idea outline a backup plan - what is plan B to scale it down? What is plan C? What will work if nothing else works?</p>
        <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> write down your responses to the questions posed in the brief. Capture your explorations of the technology as images; focus on the things you WERE NOT able to do. Post your work on openProcessing.</p>
